Instead, programmers use naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. In the context of the provided text, the discussion revolves around two specific constants, `inf` and `-inf`, which represent positive and negative infinity, respectively. These constants are part of the floating-point arithmetic system and follow the same rules as other floating-point numbers. They can be used in arithmetic operations, and their use can optimize algorithms and find the lowest and highest values in a list of values.">constant</a> values like strings.

Python's style guide, PEP 8, provides rules for naming variables, such as using lowercase letters with underscores separating words, and avoiding reserved words.

A global variable is defined at the top level of the module and can be accessed from any code block in the program, making it useful for sharing state information or configuration between different functions. Local variables, on the other hand, are only visible within the nearest scope and cannot be accessed from the outside. The keyword 'global' is used to declare a variable as global, meaning it can be accessed and modified from within a function. By default, variables created inside a function are local and cannot be accessed from outside the function.">scope</a> of your code, you'll see an error when you try to use it:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(month_name)  # NameError: name 'month_name' is not defined</code></pre><p>Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable.

For example, you can store an integer in a variable, and then later store a string in the same variable. This is different from statically typed languages, where the type of a variable is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed throughout the execution of the program. It is important to note that while Python is dynamically typed, it is also strongly typed, meaning that variables cannot change type accidentally. However, it is still possible to explicitly convert variables from one type to another using type casting."><strong>dynamic typing</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Please, do not overuse dynamic typing!
