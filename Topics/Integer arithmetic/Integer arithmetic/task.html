<p>In real life, we often perform <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed on numerical values. | Python supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There is a difference between division and integer division. The first produces a floating-point number, while the second one produces an integer value, ignoring the decimal part. Python raises an error if you try to divide by zero. Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions. For instance, subtraction or division would be done similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what a particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory, such as += or -=. For complex numbers, you can define the method for the += operator, which would work by adding the right operand to the current value of the left operand. Additionally, you can compare objects using comparison operators such as &lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.">arithmetic operations</a>. They help us to calculate the change from a purchase, determine the area of a room, count the number of people in a line, and so on.

In such cases, Python follows a left-to-right operation convention from mathematics. It's a good thing to know, so try to keep that in mind, too!</p><h5 id="pep-time">PEP time!</h5><p>There are a few things to mention about the use of binary operators (that is, the operators that influence both operands). As you know, readability does matter in Python. So first, remember to surround a binary operator with a single space on both sides:</p><pre><code class="language-python">number=30+12      # No!

number = 30 + 12  # It's better this way</code></pre><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p><strong>Operators</strong> are special symbols indicating what operation to perform. <strong>Operands </strong>are values that the operation is performed on. Let's consider our example: <code class="language-python">30 + 12</code>. Here <code class="language-python">+</code> is an operator and <code class="language-python">30</code> and <code class="language-python">12</code> are operands.</p></div><p></p><p>Also, sometimes people use the break <strong>after </strong>binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>the operators are not in one column,</p></li><li><p>each operator has moved away from its operand and onto the previous line:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python"># No: operators sit far away from their operands
income = (gross_wages +
          taxable_interest +
          (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
          ira_deduction -
          student_loan_interest)</code></pre><p>Mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention in order to solve the readability problem. Donald Knuth explains this in his <em>Computers and Typesetting</em> series: "Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations". Following this tradition makes the code more readable:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Yes: easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest
          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
          - ira_deduction
          - student_loan_interest)</code></pre><p>In Python code, it is <strong>permissible</strong> to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code, <strong>Knuth's style</strong> is suggested, according to PEP 8.</p><h5 id="summary">Summary</h5><p>Alright, now let's quickly overview what we've learned in this topic:</p><ul><li><p>what basic arithmetic operations Python supports and how to combine them in more complex expressions;</p></li><li><p>a couple of other useful operations like calculation of the remainder of a division and exponentiation;</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, operation priority (also known as operator precedence) refers to the rule that determines the sequence in which operations are carried out in a complex expression, based on the type of the operation. | Certain operations, such as power and unary minus, have a higher priority over others, such as multiplication, division, and remainder.
