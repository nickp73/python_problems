Examples of data objects in Python include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Every data object has a type that describes how to store it in memory, which operations can be applied to it, and how to execute these operations."><strong>data object</strong></a> (a variable or a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a constant is a type of variable that, once assigned a value, cannot be reassigned. | However, Python does not have built-in support for constants, and variable names are not enforced to be constant. Instead, programmers use naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. In the context of the provided text, the discussion revolves around two specific constants, `inf` and `-inf`, which represent positive and negative infinity, respectively. These constants are part of the floating-point arithmetic system and follow the same rules as other floating-point numbers. They can be used in arithmetic operations, and their use can optimize algorithms and find the lowest and highest values in a list of values.">constant</a>) has a <strong>type</strong> that describes how to keep it in memory, which operations can be applied to this object and how to execute these operations.</p><p>A real-world analogy of types is given by biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects.

For example, a dog can bark.</p><p>In this topic, we will consider a few of the simplest data types commonly used in programming practice.</p><h5 id="strings">Strings</h5><p>Whenever you want to use textual information in your program, you'll have to work with <strong>strings</strong>. In Python, the string type is called <code class="language-python">str</code>. Strings are extremely common and useful. As discussed, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by a pair of single or double quotes. | There is no difference between the two, but there are conventions regarding their use. To include any quote in a string, you can use the backslash symbol () before the quote inside the string, which tells Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than the end or beginning of it. String literals can be used to represent textual information in a program, such as an email of a person or an organization.">string literals</a> may be delimited using either single or double quotes.</p><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in double quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print("")               # an empty string

You can hardly write any program without numbers, so let's discuss some basic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, numerical types are a category of data types that represent and handle numerical values. | They are further divided into several subtypes, including:

1. Integers: also known as ints, they represent whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. The term signed refers to the fact that the integer can be either positive or negative, as opposed to an unsigned integer which can only be positive or zero. Signed integers are used to count things in the real world. 2. Floats: they represent real numbers and have a decimal point. Floats are used to handle more precise numerical values that require decimal points. 3. Complex numbers: they are numbers with a real and imaginary component, denoted by a + bi. Each data object, such as a variable or a constant, has a type that describes how to store it in memory, which operations can be applied to this object, and how to execute these operations."><strong>numerical types</strong></a>:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-python">int</code><strong> (</strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a signed integer is a numerical data type that represents whole numbers, which can be either positive, negative, or zero. | The term signed refers to the fact that the integer can be either positive or negative, as opposed to an unsigned integer which can only be positive or zero.
